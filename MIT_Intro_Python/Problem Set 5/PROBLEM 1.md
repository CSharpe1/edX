### PROBLEM 1-1  (1/1 point)

The ONLY thing we are interested in when designing programs is that it returns the correct answer.

- ~~True~~  
- **False** 

---

### PROBLEM 1-2  (1/1 point)

Roughly speaking, under the RAM model of computation, adding two numbers takes the same amount of time as dividing them.

- **True** 
- ~~False~~

---

### PROBLEM 1-3  (1/1 point)

When determining asymptotic complexity, we discard all terms except for the one with the largest growth rate.

- **True** 
- ~~False~~

---

### PROBLEM 1-4  (1/1 point)

Bisection search is an example of linear time complexity

- ~~True~~  
- **False**

---

### PROBLEM 1-5  (1/1 point)

For large values of n, an algorithm that takes 20000n^2 steps has better time complexity (takes less time) than one that takes 0.001n^5 steps.

- **True** 
- ~~False~~
